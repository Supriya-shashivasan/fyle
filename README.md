##My favorite banks feature

### updated on 20/11/2019

The application includes a feature to add a few banks as favorites. 
For the sake of showing the functionality, this feature uses localstorage.
A more efficient way would be to use the API to store favorites seperately. As the API provided does not have this facility, I have used localstorage.
